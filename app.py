    ### Tennis Match Prediction Model

    This application uses machine learning to predict the outcome of tennis matches. The model considers:

    - Player rankings
    - Recent performance (weighted more heavily for past 6 months)
    - Player age and career trajectory
    - Surface preferences
    - Head-to-head history
    - Tournament level

    The model is trained separately for men's and women's tennis to account for the differences in playing patterns and career trajectories.

    #### Men's Tennis Model
    - Rankings have a moderate impact on predictions
    - Players typically peak between ages 25-29
    - Performance decline typically begins after age 33
    - Grand Slam performance often favors higher-ranked players

    #### Women's Tennis Model
    - Rankings have a stronger impact on predictions
    - Players typically peak between ages 21-27
    - Performance decline typically begins after age 30
    - More variability in tournament outcomes

    #### Weighted Recent Data
    The model places higher importance on matches from the past 6 months, with decreasing weight for older matches:
    - Past 0-3 months: 100% weight
    - Past 3-6 months: 80% weight
    - Past 6-12 months: 50% weight
    - Past 12-24 months: 30% weight
    - Older than 24 months: 10% weight

    ### Data Sources
    The model uses data from professional tennis matches from the ATP (men) and WTA (women) tours.

    ### Confidence Score
    The confidence score indicates how certain the model is about its prediction based on the available data and historical patterns.
